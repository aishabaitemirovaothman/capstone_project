Author: Aisha Baitemirova - Othman

## Overview

Mental health issues is a big problem that is affecting the lives of millions of people around the world at any given moment. Problems like anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder are just a few examples of mental health disorders that can severely damage people's lives if left undetected and thus untreated. Oftentimes people that suffer with mental health issues do not have motivation or hope to seek help and sometimes they are not even aware that what they are experiencing is not healthy or normal. Social media has been using targeted ads for a while in order to offer certain products to certain groups of people who are more likely to purchase because of their demographics or certain interests matching that product that were picked up by the platform's algorithms. I decided to build a sentiment analyzer that could detect negative and positive sentiments in the user's comments and posts. The analyzer could be used by a social media platform in order to target therapy ads towards those users who might decide to reach out for help upon seeing an ad like that.
